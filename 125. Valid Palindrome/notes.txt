we simple use two-pointer technique

one pointer at the start of the array
second pointer at the last element of the array
a bool variable that tells us if its a palindrome or not

we keep moving i forward and j backward, and keep track of the bool variable

if j crosses i and becomes greater than i, we stop the loop and return false because we havent found a valid palindrome
