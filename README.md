## About
This repository contains:
* My solutions to various LeetCode problems
* Code organized by categories and difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
* Explanations for key problems with focus on **patterns** and **approaches**

## Why LeetCode?
LeetCode is an excellent platform to improve:
* **Problem-Solving Skills**
* **Algorithm Design**
* **Data Structures Mastery**
* **Interview Preparation**

## Problem Categories
I have categorized the problems based on their types for better organization and learning:
* **Array**
* **String**
* **Linked List**
* **Stack and Queue**
* **Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree**
* **Graph**
* **Dynamic Programming**
* **Greedy**
* **Backtracking**
* **Math**

## Patterns Covered
This repository focuses on solving problems using proven patterns. Below are the patterns with examples of problems solved:

### 1. Two Pointer
* **Concept**: Use two pointers to traverse the array in different ways
* **Applications**: Finding pairs, palindrome checking, sorting
* Example Problems:
  * Two Sum II
  * Valid Palindrome

### 2. Sliding Window
* **Concept**: Use a sliding window to track a subset of data
* **Applications**: Maximum/minimum subarray, string analysis
* Example Problems:
  * Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  * Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K

### 3. Binary Search
* **Concept**: Divide and conquer using sorted arrays or ranges
* **Applications**: Search in arrays, search in rotated arrays
* Example Problems:
  * Binary Search
  * Search in Rotated Sorted Array

### 4. Fast and Slow Pointers
* **Concept**: Use two pointers moving at different speeds
* **Applications**: Detecting cycles in linked lists, middle element of a list
* Example Problems:
  * Linked List Cycle
  * Find the Middle of the Linked List

### 5. Dynamic Programming
* **Concept**: Break problems into smaller sub-problems and store results
* **Applications**: Fibonacci numbers, knapsack problem
* Example Problems:
  * Climbing Stairs
  * Longest Common Subsequence

### 6. Backtracking
* **Concept**: Explore all possible options recursively
* **Applications**: Permutations, subsets, sudoku solver
* Example Problems:
  * Subsets
  * Sudoku Solver

## Programming Languages Used
Currently, I solve problems using the following languages:
* **Java** (Primary)
* Python
* JavaScript
* C/C++ 

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your preferred language.

## How to Navigate This Repository

### 1. Directory Structure
* Problems are grouped into categories
* Each category has solutions grouped by patterns or topics

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ solutions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ array
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ string

```

### 2. File Naming
* Problems are named using their **problem title** in `snake_case`
* Example: `maximum_subarray.java`, `valid_parentheses.java`

### 3. Code Structure
Each solution includes:
* **Problem Description** (Commented at the top)
* **Approach** used to solve the problem
* **Time and Space Complexity** analysis
