in this problem, we use a difference array.

first, we find if  there exists a solution or not by comparing sum of both arrays.

if sum of gas is less and sum of cost is greater, we know we can never find the solution.

if the condition above satisfies, we continue with our code

we keep track in a variable named total, 
if total is < 0, we reset total value and increment the startingLocation
if total is > 0, we return the value since we found our starting location.
